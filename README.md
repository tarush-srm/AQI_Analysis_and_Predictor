Techniques used in this project-

  --> Exploratory Data Analysis
  
  --> Feature Scaling
  
  --> Data Analysis using Random Forest Classifier and K Nearest Neighbors Classifier
  
  --> Data Visualization
  
  --> Data Generation using Time Forecasting and Data Synthesis
  
  Model gives an accuracy of 91% based on the pollutants it's most dependent on. To achieve higher accuracy, train the model using all pollutants. It then gives an accuracy of 99%
